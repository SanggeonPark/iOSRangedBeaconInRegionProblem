# iOS Ranged Beacon In Region Problem
- This app is created for testing iBeacon dectection when the app is in background.
- When your app has 'Use Bluetooth LE accessories' background mode, iOS fails too often to detect ranged iBeacons in a region when your app is in background.

1. Every table view section is an app activation in background.
2. When iOS couldn't find ranged beacon, background color of the cell is gray. Otherwise white.
